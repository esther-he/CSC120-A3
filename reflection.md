Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
    -Abby: talking about the assignment with her helped get my thinking process started, we were able to bounce ideas off of each other
    -Nicole: helped me with seeing how the "rounds" variable could be both a parameter in the constructor and a user-entered value

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
    -Sun 7-8: TAs helped me with getting started and helped with setting up the constructor

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    -I have a lot more experience with java than with python, so I don't really have any initial impressions.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
    -Python is a lot more intuitive and less about knowing the syntax
    -Java has stricter syntax rules and you have remember more things such as adding the semicolon and curly brackets for methods
        -I like how in Java, the brackets visually contain the method 
    -printing in Java is kind of annoying, but the short cut makes it a lot better
    -because I'm more used to java, I prefer it at the current moment. But, I feel like once I am used to python, I will prefer the simpler syntax of python.
    -There are many similararities between how the two languages work, they just have different ways of doing it
        -ex: you make a "toString()" method in Java, but in python it is "__self__()"
        -ex: in Java you use "this" while in python you use "self"

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    -I definitely procrastinated too much on this assignment. I tend to really struggle with meeting deadlines, and I think the idea of having extensions and such makes me procrastinate even more. So in the future I need to pretend like I don't have the option of using an extension to motivate me to actually work on the assignment ahead of time.
